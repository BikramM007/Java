two type of classes___
                       1.Abstract Class
                       2.Concrete Class

We can not create object of the abstract class.

We can create the object of concrete classes.

Abstract method---->>There is no definition of that method
                     it is a undefine method [abstract void meth2();]

Abstract Class----->>If a class having one abstract abstract method so thats a abstract class

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.


KEYPOINT:
    An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
    It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    Abstract class we cant usage Final and Static Keyword.
    An Abstract class inherit from another sub class then we must declare method which is mention in main class
    It cannot be instantiated.
    It can have constructors and static methods also.
    It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

Lets look an Example:-
abstract class KFC{

      abstract int billing(){
      ................
      }
      abstract int menu(){
      ..............
      }
      abstract String offers(){
      ..................
      }
}

class MyKFC extends KFC{
    int billing(){
    ..................
    }
    int menu(){
    .................
    }
    String offer(){
    ..............
    }
}
public class main(){
      public static void main(String[], args){
      KFC k = new MyKFC;//we create object of sub class and reference from the super class....
      k.menu();
      k.offers;
      k.billing;
    }
}
